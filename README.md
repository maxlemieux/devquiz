# devquiz
This is a basic assessment application, containing several questions about JavaScript programming. 

All questions are multiple choice. The app displays one question at a time. Final scoring is done by a timer.

A briefly displayed alert will tell you if you answered a question correctly. Incorrect answers deduct 20 seconds from the timer, and from your score. If you run out of time, you will be given the opportunity to go back to the beginning of the quiz and try again.

At the end of the quiz, you can add your initials to the high score list.
