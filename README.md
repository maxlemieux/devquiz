# devquiz
This is a basic assessment application, containing several questions about Javascript programming. 

All questions are multiple choice. The app displays one question at a time. Scoring is done by a timer.

Alerts will tell you if you answered a question correctly. Incorrect answers deduct 20 seconds from the timer, and thus, from your score.

At the end of the quiz, you can add your initials to the high score list.
